## Nodal Point

A nodal plate can be used to remove parallax errors when taking panoramas.

However - the correct offset of the focal plane so that the rig pivots about the nodal point is related to a combination of the camera (and how it's mounted), the lens in use and for zooms, what focal length is set.

Each of these offsets can be calculated in advance - but then you need a lookup table with you - this app provides a place to store that information and can generate the lookup table for you.
